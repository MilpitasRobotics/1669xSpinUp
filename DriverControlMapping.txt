Tentative Movement Configuration (might change depending on preference of driver)

Standard Split Arcade:

Right Joystick - Turning Left and Right

Left Joystick - Moving forwards and backwards

Eugene's suggestions:

Catapult: Ideally one button for pulling back and releasing, but two are possible (one button for pulling back other for releasing)

Current Code Mapping for Catapult:
DIGITAL_R1 - Pressing this button will fire the catapult, the catapult automatically moves back into loading position once it is fired 


Current Code Mapping for Intake/Outtake:
DIGITAL_L1 - One press to start intake, hold to convert into outtake, another press to stop (keep in mind that the intake and the roller share the same motor so if one of them moves the other will move as well)

Current Code Mapping for Roller:
DIGITAL_L2 -  hold down button to start the roller, stop once released


Expansion Activation: Tentatively pressing 4 buttons down to release mechanism


Helpers functions for the driver:

Stop the intake when the catapult is not down so the catapult does not get jammed
