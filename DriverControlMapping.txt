Tentative Movement Configuration (might change depending on preference of driver)

Standard Split Arcade:

Right Joystick - Turning Left and Right

Left Joystick - Moving forwards and backwards

Eugene's suggestions:

Catapult: Ideally one button for pulling back and releasing, but two are possible (one button for pulling back other for releasing)

Intake/Outtake Control: one click of button to start or stop the intake, defaults to intake, holding button reverses to outtake

Expansion Activation: Tentatively pressing 4 buttons down to release mechanism


Helpers functions for the driver:

Stop the intake when the catapult is not down so the catapult does not get jammed
